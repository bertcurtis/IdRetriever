# IdRetriever


Welcome!

The use of this app is pretty self explanatory. The basic use is to copy all of the contents of the above folder onto your machine and then run the .exe file in the bin/release folder. BUT! There is a better way. The main use case of this app is to have it always running but not be aware of it's existance. In order to do that you need to:

1. Copy the contents of the above folder and paste them somewhere memorable (a happy place if you will)

1. Create a shortcut to the DistIdProvider.exe in the bin/release folder.

2. Cut that shortcut.

3. Run this command in the run file dialog (WIN + R) 'shell:startup'. This will open up your file explorer to the programs that will automatically run everytime you boot up your machine. 

4. Paste the shortcut in this folder. Having this shortcut here will automatically run the program everytime you boot your machine. Now run the program.

5. The program by default will only show in your system tray. This is to ensure that it's main use case (copying dist ids to your clipboard) is as simple and out of the way as possible. Refer to the help section once the program is running for more instructions.
